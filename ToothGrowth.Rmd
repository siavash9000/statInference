What is the ToothGrowth data set? 

```
The Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs 

Description

The response is the length of odontoblasts (teeth) in each of 10 guinea pigs at each of three dose levels of Vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg) with each of two delivery methods (orange juice or ascorbic acid).

Usage

ToothGrowth
Format

A data frame with 60 observations on 3 variables.

[,1]   len	 numeric	 Tooth length
[,2]   supp	 factor      Supplement type (VC or OJ).
[,3]   dose	 numeric	 Dose in milligrams.


```
Lets take look on the data:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
data(ToothGrowth)
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x=dose, y=len)) + geom_point(shape=2) + facet_grid(supp ~ .)
ddply(ToothGrowth,dose~supp,function(x) c(mean=mean(x$len),sd=sd(x$len),observation_number=nrow(x)) )
```

The mean of the data samples is higher for small doses but nearly the same for the highest dose. 
Is this also true for the real population?
